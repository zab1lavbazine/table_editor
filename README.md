# Advanced Terminal-Based Table Editor in C++

For my university project, I developed an advanced terminal-based table editor in C++ that not only allowed users to efficiently create and edit tables but also featured JSON import and export capabilities. This project seamlessly integrated the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Features

- **Table Creation**: Easily create tables with specified dimensions.
- **Data Entry**: Populate tables with data seamlessly. Supports three types of objects within each cell: Empty, Text, or Number.
- **Table Editing**: Edit and modify table content effortlessly. Supports various mathematical operations and trigonometric functions.
- **JSON Support**: Import tables from JSON files and export tables to JSON format.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Embracing the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for enhanced modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface designed for ease of use and navigation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Advanced Terminal-Based Table Editor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
$ git clone https://github.com/zab1lavbazine/table_editor.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Enter the project directory:

$ cd table_editor

3. **Compile the Source Code**: Compile the source code using a makefile (e.g., g++):

$ make all


4. **Run the Executable**: Execute the compiled program:

$ make run


## Usage

1. **Creating a Table**: Start by creating a new table with your desired dimensions.
2. **Data Entry**: Populate the table with relevant data.
3. **Editing**: Modify the content of the table as needed.
4. **Saving and Loading**: Utilize the JSON import/export feature to save and load tables.
